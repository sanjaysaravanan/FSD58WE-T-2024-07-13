Recap:

  0. Data Passing
    Parent -> Child
      Data as props to child component
    Child  -> Parent
      pass a function as props to child component
      use that function to pass data argument to the parent component
    
  1. Resusable Components
    Analyse the commonalities and use single component for all the common designs
   
Topics:

  -1. JSX as prop or children for a component

  0. Component Life Cycle:
    Initialization: JS Loads the JSX into the memory with a name

    Mounted: JSX gets loaded into the RealDOM

    Updated: Some contents or state gets updated in the Component JSX

    Unmounted: Removing the element from the RealDOM

  0.1. Life Cycle Hook - useEffect

      We are going to target each of the phases and we are going to do something on those phases( Mounting, Updating, Unmounting )

      Mounted: useEffect with Mounted
        Examples: Calculating initial value or loading some data from APIs
        
        useEffect(() => {
          // Statements to execute on Mouted phase 
          setMounted(true);
        }, []);
    
      Updated: Liking a particular product / post in instagram
      useEffect(() => {
          // mounted is a boolean state for mounting
          if (mounted) {
            // Statements to execute on update phase 
            // dependency array is must

          }

        }, [<dep-val>]);
    

      Unmounting: Deleting a product from Cart
        useEffect(() => {
          
          return () => {
            // Statements to execute on un-Mouted phase 
            // eg: clearing the un-wanted or actions
          }

        }, []);


Next Session:

  1. CRUD implementations for the students or similar application 

      CRUD:
        C - Create
          Provide a form to create a new item, the created item should be displayed in the UI

        R - Read
          Read all the data from https://fakestoreapi.com/products?limit=5
          and display those records

        D - Delete
          Delete a student from the list

        U - Update
          Update a selected student

  2. React-Router
    Window Objects:
      location -> details current url and location
      history -> track of the history of urls

    react-router-dom:
      Routing the DOM using the url path,

        uses window props location, history
    
      BrowserRouter:
        parent wrapper tag which includes the routes tag

      Routes:
        includes all the routes

      Route:
        route with a pathname binds a dom to the path

      Default Route:
        default dom element when no route/path is found

      path params:
        useParams

      query params:
        useSearchParams
        
      Link:
        Link - anchor to a specific path
        Navigates from one page to the other page
